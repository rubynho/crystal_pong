# Crystal Pong

Implementing the old Pong game with Crystal and [CrSFML](https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml) following this video from [Tantan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUE_HSgQiG0&ab_channel=Tantan).

## Running the game

In order to run the game locally you will just need the latest version of Crystal and run the following command.

- Fetch the dependencies and run the game:
```bash
$ shards install && crystal src/crystal_pong.cr
```

And voil√†, the game is running.
